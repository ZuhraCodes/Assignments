# Lab Assignment 3 ‚Äì Machine Learning Models

## üìå Overview
This repository contains the implementation of **Lab 3** for the Data Mining & Decision Support course.  
The notebook demonstrates the application of different **machine learning algorithms** on datasets, including training, evaluation, and comparison.

## üìù Tasks
### Task 1
- Implementation of the first model/method (e.g., preprocessing, simple model).  

### Task 2
- Implementation of the second model/method with evaluation metrics.  

### Task 3
- Advanced analysis (e.g., Linear Discriminant Analysis, comparison, robustness testing).
